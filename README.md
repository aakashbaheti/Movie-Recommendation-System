# Movie Recommendation System

I developed a movie recommendation system in Python using machine learning, designed to suggest movies based on a user's preferences. The system leverages collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques, analyzing user input on movies they enjoy. By identifying patterns in user ratings and comparing movie features such as genre, cast, and keywords, the model predicts and recommends films that align with the user's taste. The system is efficient, scalable, and integrates a clean interface for users to input their favorite movies and receive tailored recommendations. It demonstrates the application of machine learning in creating personalized user experiences.
